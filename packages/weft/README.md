# Weft

> *The creative expression that brings data to life*

Weft is the data leverage and analysis library of the Relational Fabric ecosystem. Like the weft threads in traditional weaving that pass through the structural warp to create intricate patterns and designs, this library weaves through your data to extract insights, find patterns, and make information useful with maximum efficiency.

## Introduction

In the textile metaphor of Relational Fabric, Weft represents the creative and expressive dimension of data processing. While Warp provides the structural foundation of storage and indexing, Weft brings that data to life through:

- **Data Transformation**: Rich APIs for reshaping and manipulating data structures
- **Aggregation and Analysis**: Statistical functions and data summarization capabilities
- **Pattern Matching**: Declarative tools for finding and extracting specific data patterns
- **Binding Management**: Efficient mechanisms for working with variable data relationships
- **Functional Operations**: Composable operations that can be chained and combined

Weft is designed as a foundational building block for working with data at rest. Whether you're performing simple transformations, complex aggregations, or sophisticated pattern matching, Weft provides the tools to express your intentions clearly and execute them efficiently. As the library evolves, it will incorporate more advanced capabilities like query planning and optimization that will eventually support [Distributed Context-Sensitive Graph Stores](../../docs/whitepapers/Distributed%20Context-Sensitive%20Graph%20Store.md) and [Advanced Query Planning for Object Patterns](../../docs/research/Query%20Planner%20for%20Object%20Patterns_.md).

### Philosophical Approach

Traditional data processing often requires verbose, imperative code that focuses on *how* to manipulate data rather than *what* you want to achieve. Weft emphasizes declarative, expressive operations that let you focus on intent rather than implementation. This approach is particularly powerful for:

- **Evolving Data Models**: Operations adapt gracefully as your data structure changes
- **Complex Transformations**: Compose simple operations to achieve sophisticated results  
- **Functional Programming**: Immutable operations that are predictable and testable
- **Expressive APIs**: Code that reads like a description of what you want to accomplish

This foundation enables applications to work more intelligently with data, setting the stage for advanced capabilities like distributed query planning and semantic collaboration.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @relational-fabric/weft
```

## Quick Start

```typescript
import { matchPattern, runQuery, createQuery, variable } from '@relational-fabric/weft'

// Define your data
const entities = [
  { id: '1', type: 'Task', priority: 'high', assignee: 'alice' },
  { id: '2', type: 'Task', priority: 'low', assignee: 'bob' },
  { id: '3', type: 'Event', priority: 'medium', organizer: 'alice' }
]

// Create typed variables
const taskId = variable<string>('taskId')
const assignee = variable<string>('assignee')

// Build and execute queries
const highPriorityTasks = createQuery({
  return: [taskId, assignee],
  where: { 
    id: taskId,
    type: 'Task', 
    priority: 'high',
    assignee: assignee
  }
})

const results = runQuery(highPriorityTasks, entities)
// Results: [['1', 'alice']]
```

## Core Concepts

### Pattern Matching with Logic Variables

Patterns use logic variables (prefixed with `?`) to capture and bind values:

```typescript
// Simple variable binding
const pattern = { name: '?name', status: 'active' }
const data = { name: 'Alice', status: 'active', role: 'admin' }
matchPattern(pattern, data) // [{ '?name': 'Alice' }]

// Complex nested patterns
const pattern = { 
  user: { id: '?userId', name: '?userName' }, 
  permissions: { role: 'admin' }
}
```

### Query Structure and Composition

Queries are declarative specifications with three main components:

```typescript
const query = createQuery({
  return: ['?name', aggregations.count('?task')],  // What to return
  where: {                                         // Pattern to match
    name: '?name', 
    tasks: { id: '?task', status: 'active' }
  },
  in: [['?department']]                           // Input parameters
})
```

### Pattern Modifiers

Express complex logical conditions with intuitive modifiers:

```typescript
import { patterns } from '@relational-fabric/weft'

// Match any of several alternatives
patterns.or({ type: 'Task' }, { type: 'Event' })

// Exclude specific patterns  
patterns.not({ status: 'deleted' })

// Optional matching
patterns.maybe({ metadata: { priority: '?priority' } })

// Sequential array matching
patterns.tuple('?first', '?second', '?third')
```

### Aggregation and Analysis

Built-in statistical and collection functions:

```typescript
import { aggregations } from '@relational-fabric/weft'

// Statistical aggregations
aggregations.count('?item')
aggregations.sum('?value') 
aggregations.avg('?score')
aggregations.distinct('?category')

// Use in queries
const departmentStats = createQuery({
  return: ['?dept', aggregations.avg('?salary'), aggregations.count('?employee')],
  where: { 
    department: '?dept',
    employees: { id: '?employee', salary: '?salary' }
  }
})
```

## Advanced Features

### Test Functions and Custom Logic

Embed custom validation and filtering logic directly in patterns:

```typescript
import { conditions } from '@relational-fabric/weft'

const pattern = [
  { score: '?score', threshold: '?threshold' },
  conditions.where(({ score, threshold }) => score > threshold)
]
```

### Dynamic Patterns and Meta-Programming

Patterns themselves can be data, enabling powerful meta-programming:

```typescript
// Patterns can be stored, versioned, and shared
const savedPatterns = {
  highValueCustomers: {
    return: ['?name', '?totalSpent'],
    where: { 
      name: '?name', 
      orders: { amount: '?amount' }
    },
    // Custom logic can be added via test functions
    filter: conditions.where(({ totalSpent }) => totalSpent > 1000)
  }
}
```

## TypeScript Integration

Weft provides comprehensive TypeScript support with strong type inference:

```typescript
interface User {
  id: string
  name: string
  department: 'Engineering' | 'Sales' | 'Marketing'
  skills: string[]
}

const engineeringQuery = createQuery<User>({
  return: ['?name', '?skills'],
  where: { 
    name: '?name',
    department: 'Engineering',
    skills: '?skills'
  }
})

// TypeScript infers return type: [string, string[]][]
const results = runQuery(engineeringQuery, users)
```

## Performance and Optimization

Weft is built for real-world performance:

- **Pattern Optimization**: Automatic reordering and simplification  
- **Efficient Binding**: Immutable data structures for fast variable management
- **Lazy Evaluation**: Compute only what's needed when it's needed
- **Query Planning**: Cost-based optimization for complex patterns
- **Hash-based Deduplication**: Avoid redundant computation and storage
