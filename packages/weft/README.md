# Weft

> *The creative expression that brings data to life*

Weft is the data leverage library of the Relational Fabric ecosystem. Like the weft threads in traditional weaving that pass through the structural warp to create intricate patterns and designs, this library weaves through your existing application data - your objects, state, and models - to make them more useful without writing bespoke code.

## Introduction

In the textile metaphor of Relational Fabric, Weft represents the creative and expressive dimension - the tools that make your existing data work harder for you. While Warp provides the structural foundation of storage and indexing, Weft operates on the data you already have:

- **Object Querying**: Treat your JavaScript objects, application state, and in-memory models like a queryable data store
- **Uniform Data Access**: Work with persisted data, reactive state, and static objects using the same APIs
- **Pattern Matching**: Find and extract information from complex nested structures without custom traversal code
- **Reactive Views**: Turn changing data into performant materialized views that update automatically
- **Rules Integration**: Add business logic and rules engines on top of your existing application state

Weft solves the fundamental problem of application data leverage: **how do you make the data you already have more useful without writing bespoke code every time?**

### Common Problems Weft Solves

- **Stop writing custom traversal functions**: Your JS objects are just data - query them like data
- **Model-driven development**: Start treating all your application data uniformly, whether it's persisted or in-memory
- **Cross-domain querying**: Query across different data sources as if they were one massive relational store  
- **Reactive materialization**: Turn your reactive data streams into performant, cached views
- **Embedded rules**: Build business logic and validation rules on top of existing application state

As the library evolves, it will incorporate advanced capabilities like query planning and optimization that will eventually support [Distributed Context-Sensitive Graph Stores](../../docs/whitepapers/Distributed%20Context-Sensitive%20Graph%20Store.md) and [Advanced Query Planning for Object Patterns](../../docs/research/Query%20Planner%20for%20Object%20Patterns_.md).

### Philosophical Approach

Traditional application development treats different types of data differently - you write SQL for databases, custom functions for object traversal, specialized code for state management, and different patterns for each data source. Weft takes a different approach: **all data is just data**.

Whether it's a JavaScript object, application state, persisted records, or reactive streams, Weft lets you work with it using the same declarative, query-like operations. This "data is data" philosophy is particularly powerful for:

- **Consistent Mental Model**: The same patterns work whether you're querying a database or filtering an array
- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: One set of APIs to learn instead of dozens of different data access patterns
- **Evolutionary Architecture**: Your data operations adapt as your application grows and changes
- **Composition Over Custom Code**: Combine simple, well-tested operations instead of writing bespoke traversal logic

This foundation enables applications to work more intelligently with all their data, setting the stage for advanced capabilities like distributed query planning and semantic collaboration.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @relational-fabric/weft
```

## Core Concepts

### Pattern Matching with Logic Variables

Patterns use logic variables (prefixed with `?`) to capture and bind values from your application data.

### Query Structure and Composition  

Queries are declarative specifications that describe what you want to extract from your data.

### Pattern Modifiers

Express complex logical conditions with intuitive modifiers like OR, NOT, MAYBE, and TUPLE patterns.

### Aggregation and Analysis

Built-in statistical and collection functions for summarizing and analyzing your application data.

## Advanced Features

### Test Functions and Custom Logic

Embed custom validation and filtering logic directly in patterns.

### Dynamic Patterns and Meta-Programming

Patterns themselves can be data, enabling powerful meta-programming where patterns can be stored, versioned, and shared.

## TypeScript Integration

Weft provides comprehensive TypeScript support with strong type inference for all operations.

## Performance and Optimization

Weft is built for real-world performance:

- **Pattern Optimization**: Automatic reordering and simplification  
- **Efficient Binding**: Immutable data structures for fast variable management
- **Lazy Evaluation**: Compute only what's needed when it's needed
- **Query Planning**: Cost-based optimization for complex patterns
- **Hash-based Deduplication**: Avoid redundant computation and storage

## API Reference

### Core Functions
