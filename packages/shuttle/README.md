# Shuttle

> *The dynamic force that carries data between all parts of the system*

Shuttle provides the foundational ontology and construction primitives for building data flow and coordination capabilities within the Relational Fabric ecosystem. Like the shuttle in traditional weaving that seamlessly carries different threads between warp threads, this library provides both the conceptual framework for what coordination systems can be and the essential building blocks that enable developers to construct their own flow and coordination systems by hand.

## The Challenge

When building systems that need to coordinate data flow and manage complex interactions, you face the same fundamental challenges:

- **Conceptual Gap**: What does it even mean to "coordinate" or "orchestrate" data flow in your specific domain?
- **Construction Complexity**: How do you build message passing systems, event coordination, and flow control from scratch?
- **Semantic Consistency**: How do you ensure your coordination system has coherent semantics across different communication patterns?
- **Reusable Foundations**: How do you avoid rebuilding flow primitives, boundary management, and synchronization mechanisms in every project?

Without a foundational ontology for what coordination systems are and construction primitives for building them, every project reinvents these concepts with incompatible approaches and subtle timing bugs.

## The Approach

Shuttle provides both the ontological framework and the manual construction primitives for building coordination systems:

**Flow & Coordination Ontology**:
- Foundational definitions of what constitutes valid data flow patterns
- Conceptual framework for message passing and event coordination
- Semantic models for boundary management and synchronization
- Ontological patterns for flow control and system orchestration

**Construction Primitives**:
- Building blocks for assembling your own message passing systems
- Components for constructing custom coordination protocols by hand
- Raw materials for building flow control implementations
- Tools for managing boundaries and synchronization across system components

## Core Concepts

### Flow & Coordination Ontology

The foundational framework that defines what coordination systems can be:

- **Flow Structures**: What constitutes valid coordination patterns and data flow graphs
- **Graph Composition**: Implements Filament's composition algebra for flow and coordination graphs
- **Event Semantics**: How events should flow and coordinate across system boundaries

### Message Passing Construction Primitives

Building blocks for constructing systems that coordinate communication between components:

- **Message Definition Primitives**: Tools for defining message types and protocols in your coordination system
- **Routing Mechanism Components**: Raw materials for building message routing and delivery systems
- **Protocol Assembly Building Blocks**: Components for assembling communication protocols
- **Delivery Guarantee Primitives**: Tools for handling different delivery and ordering semantics

### Flow Control Construction Primitives

Components for building systems that manage data movement and timing:

- **Flow Strategy Builders**: Tools for defining how data moves through system components
- **Backpressure Management Components**: Building blocks for handling flow control and resource limits
- **Buffering Primitives**: Raw materials for managing data queuing and flow smoothing
- **Rate Control Tools**: Components for managing flow rates and system load

### Boundary Management Construction Primitives

Raw materials for building sophisticated boundary and coordination systems:

- **Boundary Detection Tools**: Components for identifying and establishing system boundaries
- **Boundary Crossing Primitives**: Building blocks for managing data movement across boundaries
- **Isolation Mechanism Builders**: Tools for constructing isolation and encapsulation systems
- **Cross-Boundary Coordination Frameworks**: Raw materials for coordinating across system boundaries

### Event Coordination Construction Primitives

Building blocks for assembling event-driven coordination systems:

- **Event Definition Tools**: Components for modeling event types and relationships
- **Event Routing Primitives**: Building blocks for event distribution and coordination
- **Event Ordering Builders**: Raw materials for constructing event sequencing and causality systems
- **Event Aggregation Components**: Tools for collecting and correlating related events

### Synchronization Construction Primitives

Components for building temporal coordination and synchronization systems:

- **Lock Management Builders**: Tools for constructing concurrency control systems
- **Consensus Protocol Components**: Building blocks for distributed agreement systems
- **Temporal Coordination Primitives**: Raw materials for time-based coordination
- **State Synchronization Tools**: Components for maintaining consistency across distributed components

## Installation

```bash
npm install @relational-fabric/shuttle
```

## Philosophy

Shuttle embodies the principle of providing both the conceptual foundation and the construction toolkit. Rather than giving you a finished coordination framework, Shuttle gives you:

- **Ontological Clarity**: A clear framework for what coordination systems can be
- **Construction Freedom**: The building blocks to create exactly what you need
- **Semantic Consistency**: Foundational concepts that ensure coherent coordination behavior
- **Evolutionary Architecture**: Primitives that adapt as your coordination needs evolve

This enables:
- **Domain-Specific Coordination Systems**: Build coordination patterns tailored to your specific system requirements
- **Consistent Mental Models**: Use the same foundational concepts across different coordination approaches
- **Manual Construction**: Assemble coordination systems by hand with full control over behavior
- **Composition Over Frameworks**: Build complex coordination capabilities from simple, well-understood primitives

## Integration with the Ecosystem

### Built on Filament

Shuttle uses Filament's foundational abstractions as the basis for representing coordination ontologies and constructing flow system components.

### Enables Flow for Weft Results

Shuttle's coordination primitives enable query results from Weft to flow through coordination systems, connecting data discovery with data movement.

### Coordinates Warp Operations

Shuttle's flow and coordination capabilities enable sophisticated coordination of storage operations, distributed transactions, and cross-system data movement.

## Contributing

Shuttle is part of the Relational Fabric ecosystem. See the [main repository](../../) for contribution guidelines.

Since Shuttle provides foundational ontologies and construction primitives, we welcome contributions that enhance the conceptual framework or add new building blocks for coordination system construction.
