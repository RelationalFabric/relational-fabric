# Warp

> *The structural foundation that provides strength and stability*

Warp provides the foundational patterns and abstractions for building storage capabilities within the Relational Fabric ecosystem. Like the warp threads in traditional weaving that run lengthwise and provide the structural strength for the entire fabric, this library provides the essential primitives and patterns that enable developers to build sophisticated storage systems, indexing strategies, and data persistence solutions.

## Introduction

In the textile metaphor of Relational Fabric, Warp represents the structural foundation - the longitudinal threads that are stretched tight on the loom and provide the stable framework through which the weft threads pass to create patterns. Similarly, the Warp library provides the essential foundational abstractions that support building storage capabilities throughout the ecosystem.

Warp's mission is to provide the foundational patterns and primitives that bridge the gap between high-level semantic operations and low-level storage implementation requirements. It serves as the critical foundation that enables developers to build:

- **Storage System Primitives**: Core abstractions for building efficient, scalable storage with semantic awareness
- **Indexing Patterns**: Foundational patterns for building sophisticated indexing strategies optimized for specific use cases
- **Synchronization Foundations**: Essential primitives for building distributed data synchronization systems
- **Semantic Storage Abstractions**: Core patterns for building systems that handle RDF/JSON-LD data models natively
- **Privacy and Security Primitives**: Foundational abstractions for building encrypted storage and access control systems

### Architectural Vision

Warp is designed to solve the fundamental challenge of semantic data persistence foundations: how to provide the building blocks for storage systems that handle rich, interconnected, evolving data models while supporting both high-performance querying and distributed collaboration.

Warp aims to provide the foundational abstractions that enable developers to build storage solutions that eliminate traditional trade-offs:

- **Semantic-Native Primitives**: Core abstractions that embrace the full expressiveness of RDF/JSON-LD 
- **Pattern-Optimized Foundations**: Foundational patterns specifically designed to enable high-performance data operations
- **Distributed-First Abstractions**: Primitives that assume distribution and collaboration from the ground up  
- **Privacy-Preserving Foundations**: Core patterns that enable granular privacy and access control implementations
- **Evolution-Friendly Primitives**: Abstractions that adapt and evolve with changing data models

## Installation

```bash
npm install @relational-fabric/warp
```

## Core Concepts

### Storage Primitives

Fundamental abstractions for building storage systems with semantic awareness and type safety.

### Indexing Patterns

Core patterns for building sophisticated indexing strategies that optimize for specific data access patterns.

### Synchronization Foundations

Essential primitives for building distributed data synchronization and conflict resolution systems.

### Semantic Storage Abstractions

Foundational patterns for building systems that handle semantic data models natively.

## Integration with the Ecosystem

### With Filament (Foundation)

Warp builds on Filament's type system to provide type-safe storage building blocks with semantic awareness.

### With Weft (Data Leverage)

Warp and Weft are designed to work naturally together, with Warp's storage building blocks complementing Weft's data leverage patterns. While each library has its own independent purpose, they share common foundations that enable seamless integration.

## Contributing

Warp is part of the Relational Fabric ecosystem. See the [main repository](../../) for contribution guidelines.

Since Warp is still in early development, this is an excellent time to contribute to its design and architecture. We welcome input on storage primitives, indexing patterns, and foundational abstractions.

---

Warp provides the foundational abstractions that enable sophisticated storage capabilities throughout the Relational Fabric ecosystem. By providing well-designed primitives rather than complete solutions, Warp enables developers to build storage systems that are both powerful and perfectly suited to their specific needs.
