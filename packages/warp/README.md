# Warp

> *The structural foundation that provides strength and stability*

Warp provides the foundational patterns and abstractions for building storage capabilities within the Relational Fabric ecosystem. Like the warp threads in traditional weaving that run lengthwise and provide the structural strength for the entire fabric, this library provides the essential primitives that enable developers to build sophisticated storage systems, indexing strategies, and data persistence solutions.

## The Problem

When building applications that need to persist and index data, you constantly need the same foundational capabilities:

- Transaction logs for tracking changes and enabling synchronization
- In-memory indexing strategies for fast data access
- Object graph diff algorithms for efficient updates
- Merge semantics for handling concurrent modifications
- Incremental update patterns for large datasets
- Change detection and notification systems

These primitives get rebuilt from scratch in every project, often with subtle bugs and performance issues.

## The Solution

Warp extracts these proven primitives from a working system and provides them as composable building blocks:

- **Transaction Logging**: Immutable append-only logs for tracking all data changes
- **In-Memory Indexing**: High-performance indexing strategies for different data access patterns
- **Object Graph Diffs**: Efficient algorithms for detecting and representing changes
- **Merge Semantics**: Consistent handling of concurrent modifications and conflict resolution
- **Incremental Updates**: Patterns for handling large datasets with minimal overhead
- **Change Detection**: Systems for efficiently detecting and broadcasting changes

## Core Concepts

### Transaction Logging

The foundation of reliable data persistence is maintaining an immutable record of all changes:

- **Append-Only**: Changes are recorded sequentially without modifying past entries
- **Immutable**: Once written, transaction entries cannot be altered
- **Ordered**: Changes maintain a clear chronological sequence
- **Recoverable**: System state can be reconstructed from the transaction log

### In-Memory Indexing

Fast data access requires sophisticated indexing strategies:

- **Primary Indexes**: Fast lookup by entity identity
- **Secondary Indexes**: Efficient queries by property values
- **Composite Indexes**: Multi-property indexing for complex queries
- **Incremental Maintenance**: Keeping indexes up-to-date as data changes

### Object Graph Diffs

Efficient change detection is crucial for performance:

- **Minimal Diffs**: Generate the smallest possible representation of changes
- **Structural Awareness**: Understand nested objects and collections
- **Type-Aware**: Handle different data types appropriately
- **Batch Operations**: Process multiple changes efficiently

### Merge Semantics

Handling concurrent modifications requires clear, consistent rules:

- **Conflict Detection**: Identify when concurrent changes conflict
- **Resolution Strategies**: Consistent algorithms for resolving conflicts
- **Merge Algorithms**: Combine changes from multiple sources
- **Consistency Guarantees**: Ensure data integrity is maintained

### Incremental Updates

Working with large datasets requires efficient update patterns:

- **Lazy Loading**: Load data only when needed
- **Partial Updates**: Modify only changed portions
- **Streaming Updates**: Handle continuous data changes
- **Memory Management**: Efficient use of available memory

## Installation

```bash
npm install @relational-fabric/warp
```

## Philosophy

Warp embodies the principle of providing building blocks rather than complete solutions. The primitives are designed to be:

- **Composable**: Combine in different ways to build various storage systems
- **Flexible**: Adapt to different data models and access patterns
- **Performant**: Optimized for common operations while remaining general
- **Testable**: Each primitive can be tested and validated independently

## Integration with the Ecosystem

### With Filament (Foundation)

Warp builds on Filament's entity primitives to provide type-safe storage building blocks that understand entity identity and relationships.

### With Weft (Data Leverage)

Warp and Weft are designed to work naturally together, with Warp's storage building blocks complementing Weft's pattern matching and query capabilities. The transaction log provides a foundation for incremental query evaluation.

## Contributing

Warp is part of the Relational Fabric ecosystem. See the [main repository](../../) for contribution guidelines.

Since Warp is still in early development, this is an excellent time to contribute to its design and architecture. We welcome input on storage primitives, indexing patterns, and foundational abstractions.
