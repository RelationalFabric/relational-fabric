# Warp

> *The structural foundation that provides strength and stability*

Warp will be the storage and indexing foundation of the Relational Fabric ecosystem. Like the warp threads in traditional weaving that run lengthwise and provide the structural strength for the entire fabric, this library provides the durable, high-performance foundation that enables sophisticated pattern matching, distributed synchronization, and collaborative data applications.

## Introduction

In the textile metaphor of Relational Fabric, Warp represents the structural foundation - the longitudinal threads that are stretched tight on the loom and provide the stable framework through which the weft threads pass to create patterns. Similarly, the Warp library provides the essential infrastructure services that support all other components of the ecosystem.

Warp's mission is to bridge the gap between the high-level semantic operations enabled by Weft and the low-level storage and indexing requirements of real-world applications. It serves as the critical foundation that will eventually support:

- **High-Performance Storage**: Efficient, scalable storage for semantic data with ACID guarantees
- **Advanced Indexing**: Sophisticated indexing strategies optimized for pattern matching and graph traversal
- **Distributed Synchronization**: Robust mechanisms for keeping distributed data consistent across peers
- **Semantic Storage**: Native support for RDF/JSON-LD data models with semantic awareness
- **Privacy and Security**: Built-in support for encrypted storage and granular access control

### Architectural Vision

Warp is designed to solve the fundamental challenge of semantic data persistence: how to store rich, interconnected, evolving data models in a way that supports both high-performance querying and distributed collaboration. Traditional databases force you to choose between flexibility and performance, between semantic richness and operational efficiency.

Warp aims to eliminate these trade-offs by providing:

- **Semantic-Native Storage**: Data models that embrace the full expressiveness of RDF/JSON-LD while maintaining high performance
- **Pattern-Optimized Indexing**: Index structures specifically designed to accelerate the pattern matching operations that Weft performs
- **Distributed-First Design**: Architecture that assumes distribution and collaboration from the ground up, not as an afterthought  
- **Privacy-Preserving Foundations**: Storage mechanisms that support the granular privacy and access control required for collaborative applications
- **Evolution-Friendly**: Storage that adapts and evolves with your data models without costly migrations

This foundation will enable the advanced capabilities envisioned in [Distributed Context-Sensitive Graph Stores](../../docs/whitepapers/Distributed%20Context-Sensitive%20Graph%20Store.md), providing the robust storage layer needed for semantic collaboration, data sovereignty, and distributed consensus.

## Current Status

⚠️ **Early Development**: Warp is currently in the early design and prototyping phase. The basic index state interface exists, but most functionality is planned for future implementation.

## Planned Architecture

### Storage Engine

The core storage engine will provide basic CRUD operations, batch operations for efficiency, transaction support, semantic querying, and subscription for real-time updates.

### Indexing Framework

Advanced indexing strategies optimized for semantic data including pattern-optimized indexes, graph-specific indexes, and semantic indexes for RDF data.

### Distributed Synchronization

Support for peer-to-peer data synchronization including connecting to remote peers, syncing specific data subsets, real-time synchronization, and conflict resolution.

## Integration with the Ecosystem

### With Filament (Foundation)

Warp builds directly on Filament's type system for type-safe storage with semantic awareness.

### With Weft (Data Leverage)

Warp will be optimized specifically for Weft's query patterns, with storage engines that understand and optimize for common application data access patterns.

## Performance Goals

Warp aims to provide enterprise-grade performance while maintaining semantic richness:

- **High Throughput**: >10K transactions/second for typical workloads
- **Low Latency**: <1ms for indexed lookups, <10ms for complex patterns  
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling across multiple nodes/peers
- **Consistency**: ACID guarantees with configurable consistency levels
- **Durability**: Multiple replication strategies and backup options

Warp represents the ambitious goal of creating storage infrastructure that is both semantically rich and operationally excellent. By building on the solid foundation of Filament and optimizing specifically for Weft's pattern matching capabilities, Warp will enable a new generation of data applications that are intelligent, collaborative, and performant.

The journey from the current basic interface to a full distributed semantic storage engine is substantial, but each step builds toward the vision of truly collaborative, sovereign, and intelligent data applications outlined in our research documentation.
